# Mushroom Classification: Edible or Poisonous?

🍄 Predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using machine learning with domain-specific feature engineering.

## Project Overview

Each mushroom season, thousands of people in Germany are hospitalized from mushroom poisoning. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts mushroom edibility based on physical features like cap color, shape, bruises, and population patterns.

The main model is a Random Forest classifier trained on engineered features combining research and domain knowledge to detect subtle cues often missed by simpler methods.

## Key Features

- Counts of “dangerous” vs “safe” colors  
- Cap shape and bruising combinations  
- Population and color pattern interactions  

## Results

- Nearly 90% of edible mushrooms correctly identified  
- Zero poisonous mushrooms misclassified
